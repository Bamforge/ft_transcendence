	<p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
		We are a team of four junior developers from 42 School in Paris, France. Passionate about
		coding and innovation, we created this Ping Pong game as part of our journey to learn,
		collaborate, and have fun!
	</p>
	<p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
		Our project combines our love for games and technology, aiming to deliver a simple yet
		engaging experience for everyone. We hope you enjoy playing as much as we enjoyed building
		it.
